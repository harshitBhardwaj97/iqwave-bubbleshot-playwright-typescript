automation code written using **playwright, typescript, and faker**, for
the [iqwave bubbleshot](https://focus-check-lkm-001.web.app/) game.

similar project also created using selenium and java, which can be
found [here](https://github.com/harshitBhardwaj97/IQWave-BubbleShot-Selenium-Java).

strategies.
