# iqwave bubbleshot automation (playwright typescript) 🎯

automation code written using **playwright, typescript, and faker**, for
the [iqwave bubbleshot](https://focus-check-lkm-001.web.app/) game.

similar project also created using selenium and java, which can be
found [here](https://github.com/harshitBhardwaj97/IQWave-BubbleShot-Selenium-Java).

this project automates the game using **both xpath and css selectors** 🔍, allowing a side-by-side comparison of locator
strategies.
